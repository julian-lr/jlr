## 👋 About Me

```yaml
name: Julian Laurito Riscica
location: Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷
current_role: Lead Email Developer @ Accenture Song
education: "Currently studying Business Administration · Certified in Web Dev, JavaScript, and React"
technologies: ["HTML", "CSS", "SCSS", "JavaScript", "React", "TypeScript", "Salesforce Marketing Cloud"]
```

I'm a passionate front-end developer (in progress) with a strong background in quality assurance and email development. I have around 4 years of QA experience and 3 years in email development, and I’m now transitioning into a full-fledged front-end role.

At Accenture Song, I lead a team of email developers, building and delivering high-quality campaigns. My roots in QA mean I bring a deep focus on detail and cross-platform consistency. These days, I’m expanding my frontend skillset while also diving into the world of business.

## 📁 My projects

### [Personal Portfolio](https://julianlr.com) · [Repo](https://github.com/julian-lr/julian-lr)
A clean and minimal single-page site to present my work and experience. Built with React and SCSS, deployed on Cloudflare.

### [ReactJS E-Commerce](https://github.com/julian-lr/ReactJS-CH-JLR)
Final project from Coderhouse’s React course. A store app with cart logic, routing, Firebase integration, and a few UI flourishes for good measure.

### [Web Dev Course Site](https://github.com/julian-lr/Web-Development-CH-JLR)
A multipage responsive site from the web dev certification. Classic layout focus, mobile-first design, and clean structure.

### [JavaScript E-Commerce Project](https://github.com/julian-lr/JavaScript-CH-JLR)
A basic e-commerce site built with vanilla JavaScript. It includes cart logic, product listings, filtering, and integrates localStorage for persistence. Built without frameworks — just DOM manipulation, event listeners, and a good chunk of handcrafted logic.

### [HTML Email Template](https://github.com/julian-lr/Email-demo-JLR)
Email template designed for cross-client compatibility and responsive layout. Tables, inline styles, and good old-fashioned bulletproof code.

### [AllNighter V2](https://github.com/julian-lr/allnighter-v2)
A small utility for email developers to convert special characters into HTML-safe encodings. Originally built to avoid broken characters in legacy ESPs. Now deprecated, but still a handy tool for basic conversion logic.
