## 🧭 Learning Timeline

2011 → Built my first HTML and CSS pages at 14 — just personal mini-projects

2018 → Started exploring QA and found joy in catching bugs
2023 → Certified in Web Dev, JavaScript, and React (Coderhouse)
2024–Now → Polishing frontend skills, writing cleaner code, and pushing beyond just emails
```
